The impact of this problem is significant for movie producers, directors, and investors who want to understand what makes a movie successful to make informed decisions in their future projects.

## Apporach :

· Understood the dataset provided

· Have done the data cleaning as described in the data cleaning table

· Used appropriate functions and formulas to get the requried answers for each questions

## Tools & Technologies Used :

· Microsoft Excel (2019) & it's functions and forumulas.

## KPI's :

### 1) Movie Genre Analysis:

· Extracted the most common genres of movies in the dataset. Then, for each genre, calculated the descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation) of the IMDB scores.

· Applied "COUNTIF","AVERAGEIF","MEDIAN","MODE","MINIFS","MAXIFS","VAR" & "STDEV" functions.

· Visualized the Genres and their IMDB Scores using bar plot.

### 2) Movie Duration Analysis:

· Analyzed the distribution of movie durations and identified the relationship between movie duration and IMDB score.

· Calculated the descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for movie durations using excel's functions like AVERAGE, MEDIAN, and STDEV.

· Visualized the result using scatter plot and inserted a trend line to understand the relationship.

### 3) Language Analysis:

· Showed the most common languages used in movies and analyzed their impact on the IMDB score using descriptive statistics.

· Used the excel's COUNTIF function to count the number of movies for each language and calculated the mean, median, and standard deviation of the IMDB scores for each language.

· Visualized the result using bar plot.

### 4) Director Analysis:

· Identified the top directors based on their average IMDB score and analyzed their contribution to the success of movies using percentile calculations.

· Used excel functions "AVERAGEIF","RANK" & "PERCENTRANK" and visualized the results using a vertical bar chart.

### 5) Budget Analysis:

· Analyzed the correlation between movie budgets and gross earnings, and identified the movies with the highest profit margin.

· Calculated profit for each movies (gross earnings - budget).

· Applied "RANK" function to get the rank for each movies based on their profit value and to know the top 20 movies.

· Visualized the top 20 movies with their budget and profits.

## Conclusion :

· The IMDb movie analysis using Excel has provided comprehensive insights into movie trends, ratings, and genre performance. Our analysis of key metrics, such as average ratings, box office performance, and genre distribution, has highlighted significant patterns and correlations in the data.

· The analysis identified interesting patterns in movie ratings. For instance, movies with high production budgets tend to receive higher ratings, while certain directors or actors are associated with higher average ratings, suggesting a correlation between industry talent and viewer satisfaction.

· Based on our findings, we recommend focusing on high-performing genres and investing in movies with strong directorial teams and popular actors. Additionally, leveraging data-driven insights can aid in making strategic decisions about film production and marketing.
